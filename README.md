# Yet Another Ray Tracer (YART)

Inspired by ["The Ray Tracer Challenge"](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/), a book by Jamis Buck, I set out to build a ray tracer in C++ as an attempt to transition from C and practicing test-driven development.

As with [YACE](https://github.com/nhtranngoc/yace), I will continue to use CMake as a build system and Google Tests as a testing framework.

# Build Instructions
```shell
cd ./build/
cmake ..
make
make run
```
